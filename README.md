# Problem Statement
The AtliQ Hardware Sales Insights Project endeavors to transform the way the company navigates its sales landscape. Faced with challenges in tracking sales amid dynamic market growth and verbal updates from regional managers lacking concrete evidence, the Sales Director seeks a data-driven solution. Our project objective is to provide AtliQ Hardware with a Power BI dashboard, offering real-time insights and addressing the decline in overall sales. Key features include dynamic market tracking, regional performance metrics, and daily accessible data. The benefits encompass data-driven decision-making, increased sales through strategic planning, and more efficient communication. The project invites contributions for dashboard development, insights sharing, and collaborative feedback, aiming to empower the Sales Director and the organization with actionable insights for sustainable growth. Your valuable contributions are crucial to the success of this initiative! ðŸš€
